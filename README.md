# Boreal (the largely stationary) Caribou
 
Early days but have attempted to see if the distance travelled by each caribou is indicative of its sub species.

So far I have found that using KMeans clustering inertial on distances it shows roughly 4 clear groups which is about right. This is my first attempt at this hence why this read me is not great.

## Files So far.
I have just the CaribouLocation jupyter notebook so far. Will update and comment it as time passes.

If you fancy a gander at it, fair warning its a mine field and I know there must be a better/faster way of finding the distance between two gps co-ordinates.
