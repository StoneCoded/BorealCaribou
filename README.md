# Boreal (the largely stationary) Caribou
 
Early days but have attempted to observe differences in activity for each caribou sub species.


## Files So far.
I have just the CaribouLocation jupyter notebook so far. Will update and comment it as time passes.

If you fancy a gander at it, fair warning its a mine field.


## Licences
I have yet to write this up fully but in the mean time you fancy a gander at the dataset itself you will find it on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/caribou-location-tracking?select=locations.csv) along with documentation, licences etc.
