## 1. Installation

To get this inital code running, you will only need the standard Anaconda distribution of Python 3.

## 2. Motivation

As I try to improve my ability I am looking for tasks that catch my attention. I was interested in finding a suitable way of visualising latitudinal/longitudinal distance data in a simple and clear manner. I haven't tackled this kind of data before so thought what the hell.

The data I've chosen is the Caribou Location Tracking that contains tracking data of 260 woodland caribou from British Columbia, Canada between 1988 and 2016. 

## 3. File Descriptions
I have just the Caribou jupyter notebook so far. Will update and comment it as time passes. Apologies if you reach this beforehand. 

## 4. Results
Will fill this in when I find some :) 

## 5. Issues
After getting the distance calculation running in an efficient manner I now need to split the data into its individual animals so as not to overlap the distance calc.

If you fancy a gander at it, fair warning its a mine field.


## 6. Licences
I have yet to write this up fully but in the mean time you fancy a gander at the dataset itself you will find it on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/caribou-location-tracking?select=locations.csv) along with documentation, licences etc.
